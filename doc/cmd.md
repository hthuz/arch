## KDE  

### SDDM
Default configuration file: ```/usr/lib/sddm/sddm.conf.d/default.conf```  
Configuration change: ```/etc/sddm.conf.d/```  
Autologin: ```/etc/sddm.conf.d/autologin.conf```  

## Swap Esp and Caps  

`setxkbmap -option caps:swapescape`. Add this to `.xinitrc`
Note that is requires $DISPLAY available

Alternative ways, this set swap permanently:

`loadkeys keys.conf`,


```text
keycode 1 = Caps_Lock
keycode 58 = Escape
```

Linux version of VSC doen't respect remapping with xkbmap. To solve it, 
add `"keyboard.dispath": "keyCode"` in `settings.json`

##  Processes

### Show Processes   

`top` or `htop`  Display processes and memory use
`up/down` to navigate  
`k` to kill  

On top right, it shows info of command `uptime` and number of tasks,threads,kernel threads. 
And how many are running. See explanation of this command for details.

Press `F5` to see process tree(Which is parent proc and which is child proc)
By default, `htop` shows all threads. Press`<S-h>` to toggle thread and `<S-k>` to toggle kernel thread.

Attribute | Description  
----------| ----------
VIRT      | Amount of virtual memory
RES       | Resident size. Amount of physical memory  
SHR       | Amount of memory shared  
S         | State of process
TIME+     | Total CPU time consumed by process

State   | Description
--      | --
D       | uninterruptible sleep
R       | running  
S       | sleeping  
T       | traced or stopped  
Z       | zombie

Process Status command, display current running processes only
CMD     | Description
--      | --
`ps`    | start
`ps -u` | more information
`ps -A` | display all processes
`ps aux` | 

Example: 
```
root      3339  0.0  0.0 119428   972 pts/19   S+   16:26   0:00 grep --color=auto cmd
root     28020 26.3  0.0 1440780 55712 pts/17  Sl+  15:59   7:05 ./cmd
```
15:59 means the start time of this process. If it started at 24 hours ago, the format will be like "Oct18"

7:05 means the accumulated cpu time (user + system) for this process is 7 minutes and 5 seconds. The format is MMM:SS.
It's not the total running time of the proces up to now.

### Kill Processes
CMD                 | Description
--                  | --
`kill (-9)[pid]`    | kill a process. -9 is SIGKILL, by default
`kill -L`           | list all signals
`killall [pname]`     | kill a process


### nproc

`nproc` returns number of cores in CPU.

### Uptime
Information from `/proc/uptime` and `/proc/loadavg`

Content of `/proc/loadavg`
```shell
0.74 0.56 0.42 1/417 316088
```
Average of number of processes being executed or in waiting state of last 1,5,15 minutes. 1 task running and 417 tasks in total. Last process id is 316088.

Note that one core in CPU can only execute one process at a time.
So if there's only one core in CPU, average load of 1 means 1 process was running on the CPU over last 1 minute, which means CPU was fully utilized.  
If load average is 0.4 for 5 minute period, it means CPU was idle by 60%.
If load average is 3.35 for 15 minute period, it means 2.35 process were waiting for CPU.

If the CPU has two cores, 
1.00 for 1 minute period means 1 core was being used one 1 core was idle.
0.40 for 5 minute period means CPU was idle by 160% on average.
3.35 for 15 minute minutes means 1.35 processes were waiting for CPU.


```shell
$ uptime
 13:10:42 up  4:38,  1 user,  load average: 0.76, 1.19, 0.95
```
which says system has been up for 4h38m.
Load average: average system load over a period of time.

### Process tree

Example

1. Save the website, Note that `https//` can't be ignored
```bash
curl -o kernel.html https://www.kernel.org
```

```bash
curl -O https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.txt
curl -O https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.pdf

curl -I www.kernel.org
```
The command will say 301 moved permanently. The useful Location is
presented as `https://www.kernel.org` with Location key in the output

Use `--location (-L)` to redo the request with new position. This will represent the result
```bash
curl -L www.kernel.org
```

4. Combined together
```bash
curl -o -L kernel.html www.kernel.org

## curl
Client URL

`curl [options] [URL...]`

curl -O URL                 | Save the downloaded file in a file with the same name as URL

Example

1. Save the website, Note that `https//` can't be ignored
```bash
curl -o kernel.html https://www.kernel.org
```
2. Download a file in the website. Sed txt and pdf example here
```bash
curl -O https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.txt
curl -O https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.pdf
```
3. Redirects, no https/ (-I displays only the request header)
```bash
curl -I www.kernel.org
```
The command will say 301 moved permanently. The useful Location is
presented as `https://www.kernel.org` with Location key in the output

Use `--location (-L)` to redo the request with new position. This will represent the result
```bash
curl -L www.kernel.org
```

4. Combined together
```bash
curl -o -L kernel.html www.kernel.org
```
