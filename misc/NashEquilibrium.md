# Nash Equilibrium

Nash Equilibrium: no player could gain (increase payoff) by changing their own strategy, while others keep their strategy unchanged.

In such a condition, no palyer is willing to switch strategy

In a formal form  
Suppose $N$ players in total, each denoted by $i$,  
$S_i$ is the set of all strategy taken by player $i$,
$s_i \in S_i$  
$s^*=(s^*_i, s^*_{-i})$ is a strategy profile,  $s^*_{-i}$ is strategies taken by all players except $i$.  
$u_i(s_i, s^*_{-i})$ is player $i$'s payoff  

Then $s^*$ is **Nash Equilibrium** if
$$
u_i(s^*_i, s^*_{-i}) \ge u_i(s_i, s^*_{-i}) \ for\ all\ s_i \in S_i
$$

It's **strict Nash Equilibrium** if the inequality is strict so one strategy is the unique best response.

$$
u_i(s^*_i, s^*_{-i}) \gt u_i(s_i, s^*_{-i}) \ for\ all\ s_i \in S_i
$$
